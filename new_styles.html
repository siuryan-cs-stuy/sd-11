      <p>Bring her forward! Look, my liege! Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Well, we did do the nose. And the hat. She's a witch!</p>
      <p>…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? We found them. Well, she turned me into a newt. <strong> Camelot!</strong> <em> Be quiet!</em> …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?</p>
      <h2>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.</h2>
      <p>Well, how'd you become king, then? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Burn her anyway! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>

      <h3>I'm not a witch.</h3>
      <p>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!</p>

        <li>Did you dress her up like this?</li><li>I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</li><li>Did you dress her up like this?</li>

      <p>How do you know she is a witch? And the hat. She's a witch! Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
      <p>Why? The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
      <p>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. It's only a model.</p>
      <p>Well, we did do the nose. You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
      <p>I'm not a witch. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
      <p>I have to push the pram a lot. Shut up! What do you mean? Well, what do you want? You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
